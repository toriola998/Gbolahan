                <article>
                    <p>I efficiently perform allocated tasks independently and in collaborative environments.
                    With over 5 years hands-on and non-professional experience 
                    using Java, Python, JavaScript, and Flutter to create and implement software applications.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort 
                    and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are 
                    important to me and the success of your organization.</p>

                    <p>With a strong background in User Experience I always put the concerns of the User in mind. 
                    These give me the ability to prioritize features when building products.</p>
